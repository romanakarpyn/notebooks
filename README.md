<p>Description:</p>
<p>In this project, I have utilized Beautiful Soup to scrape web pages. Before proceeding with web scraping,  I verified if the site allows this kind of operation. Analyzing HTML structure,  I have selected the part of the code that I need to obtain the bank's data information and then wrote this information in a .txt file.</p>
